PyGraphviz (forked for Windows user)
----------
Note: The original repo fails installing on Windows. So I create a fork for Windows User. If your Python is x64 version, please download the x64 version Graphviz, for example from  https://github.com/mahkoCosmo/GraphViz_x64. The installation locates in C:/Program Files/Graphviz2.38. The install commands: python setup.py install.

PyGraphviz is a Python interface to the Graphviz graph layout and
visualization package.

With PyGraphviz you can create, edit, read, write, and draw graphs using
Python to access the Graphviz graph data structure and layout algorithms.
